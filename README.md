# Student Performance Analytics Dashboard
An interactive web application built to analyze student performance data and predict final math grades. This project was developed as part of the **Lund University Finance Society (LINC) Advanced Python Workshop (HT 25)**.

The project uses **Linear Regression** to identify the most important factors for higher grades in maths and provides an model to estimate student grades based on demographic and lifestyle inputs.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze the [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) and answer the question: **"Can we predict a student's final math grade (G3) based on their background, lifestyle, and study habits, without relying on earlier grades?"**
